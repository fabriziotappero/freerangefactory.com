Embedded Programming with 32bit ARM

If you are interested in embedded programming and you live in the present you might just want to forget about the ancient 8-bit Arduino thing and jump straigth to ARM programmming. We live in the 2015 and there is really no need to wonder about [1996 Atmel AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR) technology. It is infact true that for approximately US$ 0.77, Mouser will sell you a 50MHz 32bit ARM equiped with UART, SPI, I2C, DAC and nearly 1Mbps 7 channel ADC all packed in a 3mm by 3mm case.

To make your live easier, a gazilion of ARM chips and ARM development boards are available in the magic world of Internet; ranging from few US$ up to few tens of US$ for tons feature developement boards. Open-source boards, full-fledged chip manufactrer boards do rappresent the ideal development platform for embedded programming. 

Regarding programming languages, compilers and debugging solutions a lot of options are available. For instance, for an average US$29 120MHz ARM Cortex M4 development board, smartly marketed [Freedom Development Board](http://cache.freescale.com/files/soft_dev_tools/doc/user_guide/FRDM-K22F-QSG.pdf), Freescale offers classic USB-based debugging and programming, mass-storage-device flash programming via open tools like [mbed.org](http://www.mbed.org), the great open-source tool gcc, the more esoteric Jlink OpenSDA method for programming and debugging via non open-source software dev. tools like KEIL MDK, Atollic TrueSTUDIO, Rowley CrossWorks and what not.

So, where to start?
