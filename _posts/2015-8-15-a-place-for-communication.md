title: A PLACE FOR COMMUNICATION IS BORN
---

Today Free Range Factory *Talk* is born. Like its icon suggests, *Talk* is the
place inside the Free Range Factory website where discussions and announcements
take place.

For the time being, *Talk* will not include a comment section. Not because I don't
like people leaving comments and opinions, I actually do very much but it is just
that I'll need to find out how to implement a good commenting plugin for
Jekyll and Github.
