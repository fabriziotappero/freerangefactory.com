    <p>I love electrical engineering things, I love programming and I love to make stuff that can fly, normally under the form of a drone or something.</p>

    <p>My name is Fabrizio, I am an engineer and I live in Barcelona, Spain. Since I was young I have always liked to build things. Growing up I decided to keep doing it so after a lots of effort to get an electrical engineering PhD from <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au">this Australian university</a> I spent many years working as scientist and wrote <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabrizio_Tappero2">some research papers</a>.</p>

    <p>I am the co-author of the programming book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/no-frills-writing-powerful-digital-implementations/dp/B015MT2IBM"><em>Free Range VHDL</em></a> and the co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AFabrizio%20Tappero">few other books</a>. I've built and maintain <a href="http://freerangefactory.org/cores.html">this massive VHDL database</a> and I dream about building more and more things. I've built this website to share some of the stuff I like.</p>

    <p>Please have a look around and if you would like to communicate with me please <a href="../#contact">reach out to me</a>.</p>
