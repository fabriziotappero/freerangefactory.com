  This book is a fundamental guide to develop the skills necessary to write
  powerful VHDL code. The approach taken by this book is to provide only what
  you need to know to get up and running quickly in VHDL. As with all learning,
  once you have obtained and applied some useful information, it is much easier
  to build on what you know as opposed to continually adding information that is
  not directly applicable to the subjects at hand.

  This book was written with the intention of being **freely available to
  everybody**. To support our work, a paperback version can be purchased from
  our on-line store. Alternatively, please consider a donation.

  VHDL is an extremely powerful tool. The more you understand as you work and
  study with VHDL, the more it will enhance your learning experience
  independently of your particular area of interest. The concept of using
  software to design hardware that is controlled by software will definitely
  provide you with endless hours of contemplation.
