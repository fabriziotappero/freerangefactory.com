#### Who is Free Range Factory?

![about_pic]({{ site.url }}/img/fabrizio-tappero.jpg "Fabrizio")

I love electrical engineering things, I love programming and I love to make stuff that can fly, normally under the form of a drone or something.

My name is Fabrizio and I am based in Barcelona, Spain. Since a young age I have always liked to build things. Growing up I decided to keep doing it so after receiving an electrical engineering PhD from [this Australian university](https://www.unsw.edu.au) I spent many years publishing [lots of research papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabrizio_Tappero2) and working many years and Japan, Switzerland, Australia and now Spain.

I am the co-author of the programming of **Free Range VHDL** as well as [few other books](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AFabrizio%20Tappero). I built and maintain [this massive VHDL database](http://freerangefactory.org/cores.html) and I dream about building more and more things.
