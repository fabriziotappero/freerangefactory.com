    <p id="p_Description">
     ztachip is a framework for software + HDL development on a SOC-FPGA device. SOC-FPGA are chipsets that incorporate a fabric of re-configurable hardware logic combined with a standard multi-core processor.
     <br/>
     It is possible to realize many orders of magnitudes in performance increase if one can leverage the re-configurable capabilities of these chipsets by optimizing the data processing and data flow for a particular application need.
     <br/>
     Unfortunately programming for these chipsets are particular challenging since it requires a familiarity of both hardware(HDL) and software design flow.
     <br/>
     ztachip solution involves the following concepts:
     <br/>
     Reduce data latency impact by de-coupling/overlaying data-transfer and data-processing.
     <br/>
     Minimize data usage and transfer by substituting traditional caching at each processing unit with a global data engine and global caching. Data transfers are done in concurrent with data processing tasks.
     <br/>
     Minimize processing delay impact through the use of hard-multithreading.
     <br/>
     Provides simple interface for software to interact with special custom hardware blocks.
     <br/>
     Similar to a GPU architecture, ztachip is composed of a large array of processing units called pcore. Since ztachip design does not need data caching at each core, these pcores are very simple and light.
     <br/>
     Programs are written in standard C with few extensions/restrictions.
     <br/>
     Implementations show 100x acceleration for matrix multiplication when compared with program running on ARM host processor.
     <br/>
     ztachip is free to use and distribute for both commercial and non-commercial applications under the Apache License v2.0 term. (which is mostly equivalent to LGPL)
