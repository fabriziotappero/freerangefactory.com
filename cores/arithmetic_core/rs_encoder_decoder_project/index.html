    <p id="p_Description">
     This code implements a Reed Solomon encoder/decoder for both the parity size of 8 and the 16.
     <br/>
     The Reed Solomon encoder structure implemented here is the one used in ADSL G.9956 but it is
     <br/>
     also used in lot of the other emerging communication systems such as wireless 3rd generation
     <br/>
     3GPP standard (Wideband CDMA) and powerline communication standards like Homeplug.
     <br/>
     The code is not documented very well. I found it on the internet and tested it and
     <br/>
     find that it works very very good. Use and enjoy by saving lot of time implementing this big block.
     <br/>
     This code can also be used for verilog coding since is written is such as way to be easy
     <br/>
     to port it to the behavioral verilog from the C language.
     <br/>
     WARNING: SINCE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LEARN SVN I AM UPLOADING THE CODE AS A SINGLE ZIP FILE THAT CAN
     <br/>
     BE OPENED WITH winzip OR 7zip. BUT FOR THIS WEBSITE TO LET ME UPLOAD MY CODE WITHOUT SVN
     <br/>
     I HAD TO CHANGE ITS EXTENSION FROM .zip TO .pdf. SO PROCEDURE IS AS FOLLOWS:
     <br/>
     1) download file RS_Encoder_Decoder.pdf
     <br/>
     2) rename it to RS_Encoder_Decoder.zip.
     <br/>
     3) unzip it using winzip or 7zip or winRAR. You will get five .c source files and 5 .h header
     <br/>
     files and some data files and a readme.txt with insturctions on how to run the code.
     <br/>
     4) Enjoy.
