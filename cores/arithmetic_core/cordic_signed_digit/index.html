     one way to make cordic faster is to use redundant arithmetics which would allow constant and low carry propagation delay. However, it's difficult to evaluate the sign of redundant number, some methods has been proposed for rotation mode, but to my knowledge no one has tried to build a redundant number based cordic core that can work in all 4 modes. This cordic core extended existing methods for circular mode so that it can also work in hcrm and hcvm modes with some restrictions on x(x must belong to a range of [1/4,1])
