    <p id="p_Description">
     It is a 32 bit RISC processor with (3,0)register-register architecture with memory access using LD and SD instruction. The design has branch penalty of 1 clock cycle. The architecture is a 5-stage pipelined structure with forwarding implemented to minimize Data Hazards. It has separate Instruction and Data Memory. It has been tested with 10 testcases and total number of clock cycles were calculated for each instruction set. The results conform to the expected count.
