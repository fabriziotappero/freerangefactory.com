     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     System on Module based on Xilinx ZYNQ SoC that combines dual Core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores with Programmable Logic in single device. This open hardware System on Module is designed to be very low cost, for this purpose large external DDR memory is not included, neither are any PHY devices (USB/Ethernet) on the module.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     * Real Open Source(tm): All production and support files released to public!
     <br/>
     * Low cost 6 layer PCB technology, no buried or blind vias
     <br/>
     * Small form factor, 40x75mm - smaller than credit card
     <br/>
     * Single 3.3V supply
     <br/>
     * Xilinx ZYNQ XC7Z7010 (can be upgraded with XC7Z7020)
     <br/>
     ** Dual ARM Cortex A9 Core
     <br/>
     ** Artix(tm) FPGA Programmable Logic
     <br/>
     ** Microblaze(tm) Soft Processors can be implemented in fabric with free Vivado tools
     <br/>
     ** own soft-processors and peripheral cores can be implemented in FPGA
     <br/>
     * 16 to 256MB NOR Flash (max 32Mbyte usable as linear XiP memory for the CPU's)
     <br/>
     * one push-button that works as reset or user button (uses MSP430 as "button controller")
     <br/>
     * 3 LED's (connected to: CPU GPIO, FPGA, button controller)
     <br/>
     * SMD DIP switch to select boot mode either from SD Card or SPI Flash
     <br/>
     * up to 54 user I/O (in all 3 connectors: 42 + 8 + 4)
     <br/>
     * "cloud ready" when used with "Electric Imp" smart Wifi SD Card
     <br/>
     * iSDIO Wifi Card support (to be confirmed!)

     Connectivity
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Connectivity">
     * Bluetooth BT/BLE with either onboard Antenna or U.fl connector
     <br/>
     * one 12 pin Pmod Slot: 8 I/O pins connect to Zync SoC MIO pins
     <br/>
     * one 8 pin Pmod I2C Slot: 4 I/O pins connect to Zync SoC MIO pins
     <br/>
     * 50 pin IDC style connector, can be fitted as pin header, max 42 I/O
     <br/>
     * one SD/SDIO slot, can be used for SD card, iSDIO Wifi or electric imp wifi card
     <br/>
     * one micro SD card slot
     <br/>
     * HS USB 2.0 Host/Device/OTG can be implemented (need ULPI PHY)
     <br/>
     * up to two Ethernet interfaces (need RMII or MII PHY)
     <br/>

     Form Factor
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Form Factor">
     Custom form factor: 40x75mm This form factor was choosen from following constraints:
     <br/>
     * Should fit largest commonly used IDC connector (50 Pin) with 100 mils spacing
     <br/>
     * Should fit standard SD Card socket
     <br/>
     * Must be room for BGA IC sized 19x19 at least
     <br/>
     From the above constraints the minimal board size is about 40x75 mm
