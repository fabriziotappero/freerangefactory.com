     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This core is strictly an encryption/decription engine. No attempt has been made to incorporate key generation, and no plans exist to do so.
     <br/>
     The core accepts a 1024-bit exponent, a 1024-bit modulus, and a 1024-bit message. After about 1 million clock cycles, it returns the encrypted or decrypted message on the output bus. There is nothing pretty, fast, or efficient about its operation. It simply uses a brute force approach to perform the required modular exponentiation. Operation is described in more detail in comments in the source.
     <br/>
     BasicRSA was written in VHDL using Xilinx's ISE 5.2i. It has been tested using ModelSim XE for 32-bit data, but has not been verified for larger bus widths, nor has it been tested in actual hardware. This core is intended primarily as a learning vehicle for me, and any comments or suggestions to make it better will be appreciated.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - It works for up to 1024-bit modulus (Tested at 32-bit modulus).
     <br/>
     - It fits in a Xilinx Virtex II XC2V8000.
     <br/>
     - Clock Rate at 32-bit modulus approximately 16MHz.
     <br/>
     - Clock Rate at 1024-bit modulus approximately 10MHz.
     <br/>
     - Cycles required to complete operation at n-bit modulus, slightly greater than n-squared clocks.

     Status
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Status">
     - Long carry chains in adders and subtracters are the main reason for the low clock rates.
     <br/>
     - Experimentation has determined that carry lookahead adders automatically synthesized by ISE are about as good as it gets. Pipelining partial adders could improve throughput, but only at a tremendous cost in gate count.
     <br/>
     - Project status has been changed to "Stable" because no improvements have been discovered or suggested to the author.
