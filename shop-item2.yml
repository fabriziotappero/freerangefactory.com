description: |
  The XuLA is an exceptional entry-level FPGA experimental board that packs a
  [Xilinx Spartan 3A](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds529.pdf){:target="_blank"}
  200,000 gate FPGA, 8 MByte SDRAM, 2 Mbit flash, two voltage regulators and a
  supervisory Microchip microcontroller into a 51mmX25mm footprint.

  The XuLA board is made to be **affordable** and **open**, allowing you to write
  and synthesize yout VHDL code with no proprietary limitations o any kind.

  On the [XuLA Github repository](https://github.com/xesscorp/XuLA){:target="_blank"} you can
  find the XuLA board reference manual, getting started guide, board schematics,
  PCB Layout (Cadsoft Eagle) and more. All the material that you can possibly
  want is all source code.

  If you are interested in something more powerfull but still open, have a look
  at XuLA 2 board. It is a XuLA with steroids; based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.
  XuLA 2 board is available as well on this website.
