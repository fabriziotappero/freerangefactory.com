description: |
  This text presents introductory digital logic design concepts and introductory
  VHDL modeling concepts. This book focuses on block-level design and has
  removed many of the unimportant low-level digital design details typically
  found in introductory digital design texts. This book results from the
  authors' experience from working with students and teaching digital logic design.
