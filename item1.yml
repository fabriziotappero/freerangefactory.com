description: |
  The XuLA 2 board is an innovative open-source FPGA-based experimental board that
  packs a
  [Xilinx Spartan 6](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds160.pdf){:target="_blank"}
  FPGA, 256 Mbit SDRAM, 8 Mbit flash, two voltage regulators, a supervisory Microchip
  [18F14K50](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en533924)
  PIC and a MicroSD card slot into a 51mm x 25mm footprint.

  The XuLA 2 board is made to be **powerful** and **open**, allowing you to write
  and synthesize yout VHDL code with no proprietary limitations o any kind.

  On the [XuLA Github repository](http://github.com/fabriziotappero/XuLA2){:target="_blank"} you
  can find the XuLA board reference manual, getting started guide, board
  schematics, PCB Layout (Cadsoft Eagle) and more. All the material that you can
  possibly want is all open source.
