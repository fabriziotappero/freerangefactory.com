<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>Free Range Factory strives to excel in the development of open-source electrical 
  and software engineering tools for the embedded system world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to develop novel and better technologies that can improve people's 
  lives. We provide technological support to individuals, universities, small/medium 
  business as well as large entities.</p>
<p>Free Range Factory is an entity driven by a community of technology developers 
  and by its own users. Everything will be done to preserve this order.</p>
<p>Free Range Factory strongly believes in the idea of a business based on open 
  products: products that can be modified, reused and enhanced by users themselves. 
  Furthermore, when this openness is protected by a proper license scheme, the 
  evolution of the product itself and of the business activity around is likely 
  to grow.</p>
<p>Q:<em> I am running a business, how is this open-hardware licensing thing going 
  to affect me?</em></p>
<p>A: Free Range Factory is 100% business friendly and its licensing scheme allows 
  the commercial use of any product derived by Free Range Factory products. If you
