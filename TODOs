Redesign the structure of the shop. As it is not I cannot use markups for
 shop item descriptions. Idea: put everything is a folder and each shop item
 in a single file? Like for blog posts.
 This is not done. But we want to put all the shop files in one single folder
 called Â·"shop".

Contact link is now working but not scrolling smoothly...

The overall website look needs to be reviewed. Colors, fonts, titles, spacing.

The landing page patent image depends on some dir path. Make in relative.
Make them relative. It looks like in DevTips theme it is possible.

All home links are broken because done with "/". make them relative. It looks
like in DevTips theme it is possible.

change div images to figues. like this:
- <div class="client-face">
+ <figure class="client-face">

Maybe stop using this strange font resizing js and use FitText like DevTips:
- $("header h1").fitText(1, { minFontSize: '20px', maxFontSize: '72px' })
+ $("header h1").fitText(1, { minFontSize: '20px', maxFontSize: '72px' });
+ $(".biglink").fitText(1.5);

Find out what 1 or 1.5 is. Example here:

resize text with:
@media screen and (max-width: 40em) {
    body {
        font-size:90%;}
}

The shop page should not start with boring explanations. Put explanations at
the end or hidden. We should start with a nice title and funny sentence.
Important info:

TITLE: (cart) Jucy Online Shop

(credit card) Secure PayPal Payment Methods
(World) We Shipping Worldwide
(lifebuoy) 15 days Full Refund.
(track) Reasonable Shipping Fees
(office) Buy directly from Makers


For shop, change .yaml file for .md file. Is is possible_ what is the difference?
Also, can we loop inside a folder? is it maybe better just have one big shop.md
in the root folder and loop there?
Just try to create a subfolder and put a .rm file in it and see if I can import
and maybe process. Do this using the test.html file.
AWAYS TEST FIRST WITH TEST.HTML
