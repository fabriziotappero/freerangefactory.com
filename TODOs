Redesign home page links so that we use cvg icons and not immages.
 Better to first try in a test page, or not.

Redesign the structure of the shop. As it is not I cannot use markups for
 shop item descriptions. Idea: put everything is a folder and each shop item
 in a single file? Like for bblog posts.

Contact link is now working but not scrolling smoothly..

The overall website look needs to be reviewed. Colors, fonts, titles, spacing.
