  This DC/DC step-down voltage converter is based on the MP1584 and it converts
  an input voltage between 4.5V and 28V into 0.8V to 18V. This
  Voltage regulator is capable of driving up to a 3A load with excellent line
  and load regulation.

  This DC/DC step-down voltage converter is based on the excellent Monolithic
  Power System [MP1584](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/4/4e/MP1584_r1.0.pdf),

  The MP1584 offers a wide 4.5V to 28V input range that accommodates a variety
  of use for several applications. A 100Î¼A operational quiescent current allows
  use in battery-powered applications.

  High power conversion efficiency over a wide load range is achieved by scaling
  down the switching frequency at light load condition to reduce the switching
  and gate driving losses.

  The frequency foldback helps prevent inductor current runaway during startup
  and thermal shutdown provides reliable, fault tolerant operation. By switching
  at 1.5MHz, the MP1584 is able to prevent EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)
  noise problems.
